# Camera-Calibration

Small camera calibration project. 
File capture.py captures the webcam and makes the user able to record images of a checker board (size specification inside the file) using Q key.
File calibration.py takes all the captured images and generates camera calibration matrix. Then shows a distorsion removal example.
